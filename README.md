1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements (ideally in custom virtualenv)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you don't have CUDA support you should install `tensorflow` instead of `tensorflow-gpu`

3. Run jupyter lab in folder root

`jupyter lab`

Jupyter lab opens automatically in your browser. You need minimal knowledge on [how to use it](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run examples.
